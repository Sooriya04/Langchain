Berserk (manga)
Berserk  (Japanese: ベ ル セ ル ク, Hepburn:
Beruseruku)  is  a  Japanese manga  series  written and
illustrated by Kentaro Miura. Set in a medieval Europe–
inspired dark  fantasy  world, the  story  centers on  the
characters of Guts, a lone swordsman, and Griffith, the
leader of  a mercenary  band  called the  "Band of  the
Hawk". The series follows Guts' journey seeking revenge
on  Griffith, who  betrayed him  and  the  rest  of  their
comrades.
Miura premiered a prototype of Berserk in 1988. The
series began the following year in Hakusensha's seinen
manga  magazine Monthly Animal House,  which was
replaced in 1992 by the semimonthly magazine Young
Animal, where Berserk has continued its publication.
Following Miura's death in May 2021, the final chapter
that  he  worked on  was  published  posthumously in
September of the same year; the series resumed in June
2022, under supervision of Miura's fellow manga artist
and childhood friend Kouji Mori and Miura's group of
assistants and apprentices from Studio Gaga.
Berserk was adapted into a 25-episode anime television
series by OLM, which covered the Golden Age story arc,
and was broadcast from October 1997 to March 1998.
The Golden Age arc was also adapted into a trilogy of
theatrical anime films; the first two films premiered in
2012 and the third film premiered in 2013. A second 24-
episode anime television series adaptation  was
broadcast for two seasons in 2016 and 2017.
By September 2023, the Berserk manga had over 60
million copies in circulation, including digital versions,
making it  one  of  the best-selling manga series  of  all
time. It received the Award for Excellence at the sixth
annual Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize in 2002. Berserk
has  been  widely acclaimed, particularly for  its  dark
setting, storytelling, characters, and  Miura's detailed
artwork.

The Golden Age Arc (2012–13)
Guts is born from the corpse of his hanged mother and
raised by  his  abusive adoptive father,  Gambino, a
mercenary  captain. After Gambino's death, Guts
becomes a  wandering warrior, and  his  unmatched
combat skills eventually draw the attention of Griffith,
leader of  the  mercenary Band  of  the  Hawk. Griffith
defeats Guts in battle and forces him to join the Hawks,
where Guts learns of Griffith's ambition to rule his own
kingdom and the mysterious Crimson Behelit he carries.
The demonic warrior Nosferatu Zodd spares their lives
upon  seeing the  Behelit, warning Guts  that  his  bond
with  Griffith will  lead  to  his  doom. As  Griffith gains
favor  with  Midland's nobility and  Princess Charlotte,
Guts  grows close  to  Casca, the  Hawks' only  female
commander. When he overhears Griffith declare that he
only considers those with their own dreams as equals,
Guts resolves to leave the Hawks to find his own purpose. Griffith refuses unless Guts defeats him in
single combat. Guts  wins,  but  Griffith's subsequent despair leads  to  his  arrest after  he  seduces
Charlotte. Tortured and broken, Griffith loses the Behelit, and the Midland army massacres most of
the Hawks in a brutal ambush. A mysterious figure known as the Skull Knight warns Guts of an
impending Eclipse, prompting him to rejoin the survivors and rescue Griffith. During this time, Guts
and Casca confess their feelings for one another.
The rescued Griffith is left a crippled shell of himself, but when his Behelit activates, it summons the
Eclipse—a horrific merging of realms where four demonic beings known as the Godhand offer Griffith
godhood in exchange for sacrificing his comrades. Branded as offerings, the Hawks are slaughtered by
Apostles, humans like Zodd that have become demons in service to the Godhand, with only Guts and
Casca surviving. Griffith, reborn as the demonic Femto, rapes Casca as Guts loses an eye and arm
trying to save her. The Skull Knight rescues them, but Casca is left mentally shattered. Marked by the
Brand of Sacrifice, Guts leaves Casca in the care of the blacksmith Godo, his adopted daughter Erica,
and  Rickert—the only  Hawk untouched by  the  Eclipse—before arming himself with  the  sword
Dragonslayer and a prosthetic from Rickert. He embarks on a vengeful war against Apostles while
being  haunted by  the  Demon Child, his  and  Casca's corrupted unborn son,  twisted by  Femto's
violation.
Years later, Guts—now known as the Black Swordsman—wanders with the elf Puck. Captured by
Farnese of the Holy Iron Chain Knights, he escapes after saving her and returns to Godo, only to find
Casca missing. His search leads him to the ruined city of St. Albion, where the Godhand prepare a
ritual to incarnate one of their own. Amidst refugees fleeing the Kushan Empire, Guts rescues Casca
from the fanatical bishop Mozgus as the dead rise, forming a massive Brand of Sacrifice. Farnese, her
bodyguard Serpico, and the thief Isidro join him, while an Apostle beneath the city consumes the
Demon Child, using its essence to restore Griffith to physical form. After battling Griffith and Zodd at
Godo's home, Griffith senses lingering traces of the Demon Child's emotions within him. Hoping to

find a safe haven for Casca, Guts resolves to travel to Elfhelm, the land of the elves, allowing Farnese,
Serpico, and Isidro to accompany him—partly out of fear that his growing rage will endanger her.
Meanwhile, Griffith reforms the Band of the Hawk with Zodd and other Apostles, waging war against
the Kushan emperor Ganishka, a rogue Apostle.
Guts' party liberates a village from trolls, encountering the witch Flora, her apprentice Schierke, and
the elf Ivalera. Flora gifts Guts the Berserker Armor, enhancing his strength at the cost of his sanity.
After Apostles kill Flora, the Moonlight Child—later revealed as the Demon Child in another form—
briefly appears before vanishing. The Skull Knight confirms Elfhelm's potential to heal Casca but
warns of the armor's dangers. Boarding Roderick's ship, they evade a Kushan attack, during which
Guts briefly clashes with Ganishka. Griffith slays the emperor, merging the physical and astral worlds,
then  establishes Falconia as  humanity's last  refuge. During the  voyage, the  Moonlight Child
reappears, and the group battles a sea monster and undead pirates as Farnese begins studying magic
under Schierke.
Recruiting the merrow Isma, they reach Elfhelm, where the elven sage Danann restores Casca's mind
while aiding Farnese and Schierke's training. The Skull Knight reveals the Berserker Armor's dark
origins and his own history with the Godhand's Void. The Moonlight Child is exposed as the Demon
Child, briefly usurping Griffith's body before Griffith reasserts control, abducts Casca, and destroys
Elfhelm's spirit tree—scattering its inhabitants into the astral realm. As survivors flee aboard the
Seahorse, Guts collapses in despair. In Falconia, Casca regains fragmented memories before being
recaptured. Guts resists his inner darkness but falls unconscious as Kushan warriors—led by Silat,
Daiba, and an unexpected ally, Rickert—board the ship.
Imprisoned by the Kushan, Guts learns from Daiba that Falconia's forces are advancing—Griffith's
attack on Elfhelm was only the beginning of his conquest. Drafted into the Kushan resistance, Guts'
party prepares for war. During a royal gathering, the Apostle Rakshas unleashes trolls upon the city.
Silat rallies the defense while Farnese's magic drives Rakshas into retreat. The assassin flees to Guts'
cell,  where a  despairing Guts  welcomes death—until Silat  intervenes, killing Rakshas. In  the
aftermath, Guts is led away from the city in a trance by Kushan brahmins under Daiba's orders with
Isidro, Puck  and  Silat  tailing them.  Guts  is  then  sealed away  in  an  ancient tomb. Meanwhile,
Schierke's astral projection scouts Falconia for  Casca, her  unconscious body  concealing the
endeavour.
While briefly working as an assistant to George Morikawa at 18, Miura had already planned some
ideas  for Berserk's  development, having a  dark  warrior with  a  gigantic sword illustrated in  his
portfolio who would be the first conception of Guts.
[5][6]
 Miura submitted manuscripts to a 
shōnen
manga magazine for about four years before working for Hakusensha; however, he felt that he was not
capable enough for  it  and  they  were  also  not  interested in  publishing science fiction  or fantasy

works.
[7]
 In 1988, while working with 
Buronson
 on the manga 
King of Wolves
,
[8]
 Miura published a
prototype of Berserk in Hakusensha's Gekkan ComiComi;
[9][10]
 this 48-page prototype placed second
at the seventh ComiComi
'
s Manga-School prize.
[11]
Berserk was originally planned as a fantasy series for a shōnen audience, aligning with the magazine
that  published Miura's earlier award-winning work.
[12]
  He  eventually submitted his  work  to  a
magazine that, at the time, "was on the verge of going under," and he was switched around between
several editors before meeting his first editor.
[7]
 The serialization of Berserk began in Hakusensha's
Monthly Animal House
 in 1989.
[9][13]
 Miura commented that he landed the serial as soon as he made
his debut, so he never had the opportunity to receive much criticism from editors.
[7]
 At the outset of
serialization, Miura had no extensive long-term plan for the manga's narrative scope. Instead, he
aimed to develop a "dark hero" within a then-underrepresented fantasy genre, citing Bastard!! as one
of the few comparable works at the time. As his first original serialization, Miura admitted uncertainty
about the story's direction, prioritizing instead the development of an atypical hero.
[12]
Miura stated that the inspiration for the title was diffuse at the time of creation, and was not based on
a fully developed concept of berserkers or the Berserker Armor (introduced much later in the story)
from  the  outset. He  chose  the  word  for  its  enigmatic quality, feeling it  would leave  a  strong
impression. The title also tied into the imagery of Guts, partly inspired by Mad Max, which features a
vengeful, rage-driven dark hero in a grim world. Miura felt "Berserk" would make a perfect title to
represent his universe.
[14]
To create the world of the series, Miura was influenced by the films Hellraiser (1987) and The Name
of the Rose
 (1986), the art of 
M. C. Escher
, and the 
Brothers Grimm
's 
fairy tales
.
[12]
 Miura stated that
Berserk's dark fantasy setting and medieval European aesthetic drew inspiration from the 1982 film
Conan the Barbarian, the 1981 film Excalibur, and the Elric of Melniboné series, adding that his
creature designs emphasized realism to ground the fantastical in tangible detail.
[15][16][17][18]
 Miura
stated that he did not see dark fantasy as a genre in itself, but rather as an equivalent of general
fantasy. He commented that outside of Japan the big works of fantasy, like The Lord of the Rings,
contain dark elements, and in Japan, the fantasy genre was popularized by video games like Dragon
Quest, which were aimed at children, and therefore, expurgated the dark elements, but since he
received the  influence from  novels before that  of  those  games, Miura "naturally turned to  dark
fantasy."
[16][17]
 Initially, Miura debated whether to pursue a strictly historical narrative or a fantasy-
driven one, ultimately opting for the latter to maximize creative freedom. He integrated anachronistic
technology—such as Guts' arm cannon—and deliberately eschewed historical accuracy, compressing
various eras  into  a  cohesive yet  anachronistic whole. He  admitted this  could  confuse European
readers, but he saw it as akin to Westerners stereotyping Japan with ninjas, expressing that his
primary focus was creating manga for a Japanese audience, with no intent to appeal to international
markets.
[12]
Miura said that Fist of the North Star, by Buronson and Tetsuo Hara, was the work that had the
greatest impact on  his  own  work,  helping as  well  to  develop his  art  style.
[7][19][20]
  Miura also
mentioned animator and manga artist Yoshikazu Yasuhiko and manga artist Fujihiko Hosono as early
influences to his art style.

the  series' story  and  atmosphere, Ranpo  by  Masatoshi Uchizaki served him  as  a  reference for
backgrounds, and Nagai's Devilman and the films RoboCop (1981) and Batman (1989) inspired the
designs.
[19][20][17]
  Miura cited 
Katsuhiro Otomo
's 
Akira
  as  a  foundational influence on  his  panel
composition, having meticulously studied its framing and angles during his student years.
[18]
 Miura
said that his favorite manga series was Dororo by Osamu Tezuka, and that he wanted to create a
fantasy work that possessed dark, "muddy" and 
yōkai
-like elements.
[21]
 Miura mentioned that he
learned the fundamentals of storytelling from George Lucas, the creator of the Star Wars series, and
named the 
1977 original film
 as his favorite work.
[22][23][24]
 Miura commented about the influence of
shōjo  manga
  on  the  series, stating that  it  is  about  "expressing every  feeling powerfully."
[19][25]
Particularly, he mentioned influence from 
Yumiko Ōshima
 and 
Moto Hagio
,
[19][25][18]
 and that the
anime adaptations of The Rose of Versailles and Aim for the Ace!, both directed by Osamu Dezaki,
inspired him to read The Rose of Versailles manga and the works of Keiko Takemiya, mainly Kaze to
Ki no Uta
.
[17][26]
Some aspects of Guts (personality and design) were partially inspired by Miura's highschool friend
and later fellow manga artist Kouji Mori, by Mad Max's Max Rockatansky, and by Rutger Hauer's
performances in 
Flesh and Blood
, 
Blade Runner
, 
The Hitcher
 and 
The Blood of Heroes
.
[27][7][15][14]
Miura also  noted  a  visual resemblance between Guts  and Connor MacLeod,  the  protagonist of
Highlander
 (1986).
[28]
 Guts' prosthetic hand was inspired by Dororo
'
s Hyakkimaru, and 
Cobra'
s
eponymous protagonist.
[29]
 Kurt, the protagonist of 
Pygmalio
, by 
Shinji Wada
, and an illustration of
a giant wielding a sword, featured in The Snow Queen (Guin Saga spin-off), inspired the size of Guts'
sword, the Dragon Slayer, by mixing both characters' swords.
[19][20]
 Miura commented that when
drawing the Dragon Slayer, he wanted to emulate the effect of Kenshiro's or Raoh's (Fist of the North
Star) fist "flying out from the page," but he felt that Guts' sword did not have the same feeling of
weight as a fist. He wanted to convey an "extension of reality" feel to the sword, similar to the
depiction of the Fist of the North Star's Hokuto Shinken martial art, and make it believable for the
readers.
[30]
 Miura stated that "Black Swordsman" Guts was the first thing he was set on, but he did
not have any idea about what his backstory would be. He focused on the character development up
until  around the  third  or  fourth volume and  then  he  would think  about  what  brought him  to
revenge.
[7][19]
Some  aspects of  Griffith's personality were  also  inspired by  Mori,  though  Miura noted  that  the
inspirational roles of Guts and Griffith could often reverse. Their friendship dynamics also partially
influenced the relationship between Guts and Griffith.
[7]
 The Band of the Hawk, meanwhile, was
inspired by Miura's high-school friends.
[19][31]
Berserk is known for its frequent and often extended hiatuses,
[31]
 which date back to late 2006.
[32]
Following a pause, three consecutive chapters about Guts' childhood were published from June 8 to
July 13, 2012;
[33][34][35]
 the main storyline resumed eight months later on October 12,
[36][37]
 and the
series went on hiatus after a chapter published on December 28 of the same year.
[38]
 Miura took a
break to  work  on  his  six-chapter mini-series 
Giganto Maxia
,
[39]
  and Berserk  was  published
intermittently from April 11 to September 26, 2014.
[40][41][42][43]
 After a 10-month hiatus, the manga
resumed on July 24, 2015,
[44]
 and was published monthly until November 27 of the same year,
[45]
before entering hiatus.
[46]
 It was published monthly from June 24 to September 23, 2016, before

entering another hiatus.
[47][48][49]
  The  manga resumed publication from  March 24  to  June  23,
2017,
[50][51][52]
 and was then published on a monthly basis from December 22 of the same year to
May 25, 2018.
[53][54]
 Four months later, another chapter was published on August 24, 2018, before
entering an eight-month hiatus.
[55][56]
 Two chapters were published on April 26
[57][58]
 and August
23, 2019.
[59][60]
 Three chapters were published on April 24,
[61]
 July 22,
[62]
 and October 23, 2020,
respectively.
[63]
 The last chapter published in Miura's lifetime was released on January 22, 2021.
[64]
On May 20, 2021, Hakusensha announced that Miura died at 54 due to an acute aortic dissection on
May  6,  leaving it  undecided what  would happen to  the  series.
[65][66][67]
  The  posthumous 364th
chapter of Berserk was published in Young Animal on September 10 of the same year, which was
Miura's last work, and members of Miura's Studio Gaga, which consisted of him and his group of
assistants and apprentices,
[68][b]
 worked to finish the manuscript of the chapter.
[70]
 The magazine's
issue was a memorial to Miura, featuring a special "Messages to Kentarou Miura" booklet and a poster
of "famous scenes" from the manga.
[71][72]
 In the same issue, Hakusensha stated that the future of the
series remained uncertain and that the staff's priority would "always be placed on him—what he
would think if he were still with us."
[73][70]
 The afterword in the manga's 41st volume (released in
December 2021) from Young Animal's editorial staff stated that the future of the manga was still
undecided.
[74]
On June 7, 2022, Hakusensha and Kouji Mori announced that the series would continue publication,
using plans and thoughts that were relayed to Mori by Miura himself, as well as memorandums and
character designs that Miura left behind.
[75]
 Mori related how he had visited Miura nearly 30 years
ago when the latter was drawing "the Eclipse" event of Berserk and how his friend completed the
storyline for the manga up to its last chapter that week. Mori explained that the story for Berserk had
since gone on "exactly as we discussed at the time, with almost no changes."
[75]
 As the only person
who knows the ending Miura intended, Mori agreed to continue the series and promised, "I will only
write the episodes that Miura talked to me about. I will not flesh it out. I will not write episodes that I
don't remember clearly. I will only write the lines and stories that Miura described to me."
[75]
In a 2023 interview, on the occasion of the 42nd volume release, Mori commented that Miura "was a
manga genius bursting with talent," and that "[h]e had an eagerness to see things through to the end
as well as an outstanding ability to paint, conceive stories and employ narrative devices effectively."
For this reason, Mori initially concluded that it would be impossible to keep the series going without
Miura, but he changed his mind after meeting with the members of Studio Gaga, who had worked
under Miura, to perfect the unfinished last Berserk chapter that Miura had worked on. Mori recalled
thinking, "The thought that Miura would be mad at me doing nothing motivated me to reach a
decision." About his taking over from Miura in connection with the series, Mori stated that he still had
mixed feelings, "It may be unforgivable for me to do it, now that Miura is no longer here," reiterating
as well, "I will never add my own twist. I will simply remember and convey what Miura told me."
[76]
Berserk has continued with the credits appearing as "original work by Kentaro Miura, art by Studio
Gaga,  supervised by  Kouji  Mori".
[75][68][77]
  The  "Fantasia Arc/Elf Island Chapter" finished with
chapters released from  June  24,  2022,
[68][78]
  to  May  26,  2023;
[79]
  a  new  story  arc  started on
September 22 of the same year.
[79]
Miura's death and series resumption
8/7/25, 9:12 PMBerserk (manga) - Wikipedia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berserk_(manga)6/43

Berserk explores a wide range of themes and topics. Free will, destiny, and causality are discussed
within the series.
[80][81][82]
 Human 
resilience
 is a recurring theme, with many characters coming
from traumatic backgrounds, constantly struggling against an unjust world.
[82][83]
 Guts struggles
with destiny itself and is constantly resisting the pull of 
predetermination
.
[80]
 Griffith also embodies
this idea of resilience, by chasing his dream of ruling his own kingdom, despite his lowborn origins, as
well as free will, by his own decision to sacrifice the Band of the Hawk in order to achieve his
dream.
[82]
The series also explores human nature and morality, as characters struggle between becoming good
human beings or falling into madness and evil.
[84][83]
 Guts, at the beginning of the story, is presented
as an antihero who does not care about killing and is indifferent to people who aid him. Guts does not
act in accordance with definitions of right and wrong, he operates within a gray area. Initially he does
not attempt to be heroic or protect the innocent, though his self-motivated actions sometimes do so
incidentally.
[85][86]
 However, as the story progresses, it is shown that he is in fact a person who is
deeply conflicted internally.
[87][88]
 His tragic and traumatic past, unfolded in the Golden Age arc,
shows Guts as a more complex character.
[89][85][83]
 Anne Lauenroth of 
Anime News Network
 wrote
that  Griffith is  "not  evil  at  all,"  but  "arrogant and  brutally realistic  about  human nature." The
suppression of his own human nature would initiate his demise as the Hawk and the rise of Femto.
[82]
Friendship
, 
comradery
 and 
human relations
 are other explored themes.
[80][17]
 As a child, Guts tried to
build some level of friendship with his mercenary group,
[90]
 but due to his traumatic experience with
them, he lost trust in people.
[91][92][93]
 However, through the time he was with Griffith and the rest of
the Band of the Hawk, Guts formed bonds, friendships, animosities and co-dependencies, maturing as
well as individual.
[83][82][94][81]
 Miura stated that he based the Band of the Hawk on his own high
school friend relationship experience.
[17][31]
 Specifically, he mentioned that his friendship with later
fellow manga artist Kouji Mori partially inspired the relationship between Guts and Griffith.
[7]
 Jacob
Chapman of Anime News Network wrote that through their friendship, Guts' ambitions were elevated
and Griffith's were lowered, allowing both of them to consider a new future for the first time, one
where they fight side by side as equals and die on the battlefield, but they reject this future out of their
own personal fears, as Guts did not think he was "good enough" for a happy future and Griffith was
terrified of his lofty dream crumbling into something more mundane.
[95]
 Miura also said that the
conflict between Guts and Griffith speaks about their change after having built their personalities.
[17]
The Golden Age arc has been compared to a 
Greek tragedy
.
[96][97]
 According to Lauenroth, Griffith's
hamartia lies in how he compartmentalizes his feelings of guilt and shame that would get in the way
of his dream and how he deals to repress them. His inner dialogue in his second duel with Guts, "If I
can't have him, I don't care," marks the Golden Age arc 
peripeteia
.
[82]
 When Guts comes running to
rescue him during the Eclipse, Griffith reaches his moment of anagnorisis with his thought, "You're
the only one... who made me forget my dream."
[82]
Betrayal and revenge are major themes in the series. Guts suffered his first betrayal when Gambino
sold Guts' body to another soldier for a few coins. He would eventually take revenge against the
soldier, killing him on the battlefield, and he later would kill Gambino as well.
[83][91]
 Guts is in a quest
Themes
8/7/25, 9:12 PMBerserk (manga) - Wikipedia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berserk_(manga)7/43

for revenge after his comrades were betrayed by Griffith and sacrificed by the God Hand.
[83]
 This
desire for vengeance has been his main reason of survival.
[98][86]
Religion has been also touched in the series, mainly through the characters of Mozgus and Farnese.
Miura stated that he created Mozgus based on the concept of rigid personality to create a religious
fanatic
 character with no flexibility.
[31]
 Farnese is presented as the figurehead of the Holy Iron Chain
Knights, 
inquisitors
 tasked with burning 
heretics
 and 
witches
 at the stake.
[99]
 After her encounter
with Guts, she finds it increasingly difficult to resolve her faith with the atrocities she became party to,
as Guts, inversely, takes action against something he disagrees with. Guts denounces the very idea of
prayer, claiming that the act of clasping hands only prevents people from fighting for their lives.
Farnese eventually begins to reject her faith and the rigidity of her beliefs after finding out the truth
about Mozgus. After the battle between Guts and Mozgus, Farnese decides to follow Guts, to find a
new purpose in her life, away from her social position and the church.
[100]
Written and illustrated by Kentaro Miura, Berserk debuted in Hakusensha's Monthly Animal House
on August 25, 1989.
[c]
 Hakusensha published the first 
tankōbon
 volume of Berserk under its 
Jets
Comics
 imprint on November 26, 1990.
[104]
 In 1992, Monthly Animal House was replaced by 
Young
Animal
,
[101][105]
  where the  series  resumed publication in  October of  that  same  year.
[106]
  Miura
continued the series' irregular publication in the semimonthly magazine until his death in May 2021;
the series resumed in June 2022, under supervision of Miura's fellow manga artist and childhood
friend Kouji  Mori,  with  illustrations by  Miura's group of  assistants and  apprentices from  Studio
Gaga.
[68]
 In June 2016, Hakusensha's Jets Comics imprint was rebranded as Young Animal Comics,
and  the  first  thirty-seven volumes of Berserk  were  re-published with  new  cover  arts.
[107]
  The
posthumous 41st volume came in both regular and special editions; the latter included special canvas
art drawn by Miura and a drama CD.
[108][109][110]

In Manga: The Complete Guide, Jason Thompson awarded Berserk four stars, likening it to a blood-
soaked sword-and-sorcery epic infused with elements of Clive Barker's Hellraiser. He highlighted its
meticulously detailed medieval setting, where fantasy elements emerge with  gradual, unsettling
horror.
[4]
 Thompson, in a separate review, noted that despite its brutality, the protagonist's remorse
lent  the  story  moral weight absent in  similar works.
[234]
  For 
Anime News  Network
  (ANN),  he
acknowledged the series' shift toward a more conventional fantasy RPG structure, but praised Miura's
expansive storytelling and richly developed characters.
[83]
Matt Fagaly of Crunchyroll analyzed the Lost Children arc (volumes 14–16) for its subversion of
shōnen
 and 
shōjo
 tropes, resulting in a uniquely profound narrative.
[235]
 Carl Kimlinger of ANN
compared the  thirty-fifth volume's adventure tone  to Robert E.  Howard's  works, noting a  slight
decline in intensity but still maintaining its appeal.
[236]
 Brittany Vincent of 
Otaku USA
 declared
Berserk one of the most distinctive Western-style fantasies ever created.
[93]
 Eric Frederiksen of 
Syfy
Wire
 called it one of manga's darkest yet most emotionally rewarding works.
[80]
 Peter Fobian of
Crunchyroll  reflected on  its  deeply personal and  artistically transformative journey over  three
decades.
[237]
In 2025, in reference to Texas Senate Bill 20, which creates new criminal offenses for those who
possess, promote, or view visual material deemed obscene, which is said to depict a child, whether it is
an actual person, animated or cartoon depiction, or an image of someone created through computer
software or artificial intelligence, Vanessa Esguerra of The Mary Sue argued that possession of manga
like Berserk could be deemed illegal under the law, due to various parts of each of this manga, and
asserted that owning copies of the manga, which fell under the Texas law's provisions, might put
"people behind the slammer."
[238]
Critics consistently praised Miura's artwork in Berserk. Bertschy emphasized how the series' visual
execution stood  out,  particularly noting the  masterful cross-hatching techniques and  obsessive
attention to atmospheric detail. He found the art style reminiscent of 1950s horror comics from EC
Comics, perfectly matching the narrative's grim tone, and hailed Miura as both a skilled artist and
storyteller.
[233]
  Thompson focused on  Miura's precise depictions of  medieval architecture and
weaponry, while acknowledging occasional stylistic inconsistencies in human figures.
[234]
 McElhatton
admitted initial reservations about  the  art  but  praised its  uniquely disturbing portrayal of
supernatural elements.
[230]
 Publishers Weekly identified a distinctive 1980s aesthetic characterized
by economical dialogue, dynamic action sequences, and effective use of shadow.
[229]
Campbell described the artwork's unprecedented level of detail, comparing its visual impact only to
Claymore
  while  maintaining Berserk
'
s  singular artistic identity.
[232]
  In  his  review of  volume 27,
Campbell further emphasized how the series redefined standards for artistic detail in manga.
[239]
Yegulalp observed significant artistic evolution, noting that while early volumes appeared unpolished,
the artwork achieved remarkable consistency and sophistication by volume eight.
[240]
 Brienza noted
Miura's unusual practice of working without assistants despite the series' technical demands.
[241][f]
 In
her review for Graphic Novel Reporter, Brienza characterized the artwork as an exquisite erotic-
grotesque  fusion of Dungeons &  Dragons-style high  fantasy,  noting its  broad appeal across
genders.
[244]

Santos highlighted Miura's sophisticated manipulation of  light  and  shadow to  create immersive
environments, contrasting this  with  other  artists' tendency to  neglect background details.
[245]
Kimlinger ranked the artwork among manga's most technically accomplished, particularly praising its
emotional expressiveness, creature designs, and visceral combat sequences.
[246]
 Chetri compared the
surreal visuals to works by M. C. Escher, identifying influences from Hellraiser and H. P. Lovecraft's
Cthulhu Mythos

conveyance throughout the series.

Berserk is regarded as one of the most influential 
dark fantasy
 works.
[249][250][251][252]
 Peter Fobian,
in an essay of the legacy and impact of Berserk, called it a "monolith not only for anime and manga,
but  also  fantasy literature, video  games,  you  name  it",  comparing its  level  of  influence to Blade
Runner, further adding, "it's difficult to imagine what the world might look like without it, and the
generations of creators the series inspired."
[237]

[260]
 while Adam Deats, Castlevania

Dante
 from

Ichigo Kurosaki
 from 
Bleach
.
